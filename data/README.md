# Data Description: Steam player activity

(this is an example only. Edit this file as you see fit. It is recommended that you also include a copy of the original data used for this project in this folder - typically in `.csv` format)

We use the `games.csv` dataset available at 
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-03-16/games.csv>

The games.csv dataset has data collected for games on the popular game license selling platform, Steam, over the months from the years 2012-2021. The data set has records of 1258 games, and includes their titles, monthly player peaks, monthly average players at the same time, monthly gains/losses of players compared to the previous month, and the percentage of how closely the average players approach the peak.

(add basic summary if needed. Notice that the information above can be reused for one of the sections for the final project report)
