# Final Report for Intro to Data Science: Steam Games

## Introduction

Steam is a popular, online video game distributor with many other complementing features. Steams hosts community discussion threads, access to download community-made modifications to games sold on the platform, social media-like user profiles and friends lists that displays the users overall or recent video game activity, and sales events which are based on holidays or unique themes.

We want to analyze a dataset regarding Steam games to dive deep into the behavior of gamers on the platform.


## Packages

Loading any needed packages.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(directlabels)
```

## The Dataset

The games.csv dataset has data collected for games on the popular game license selling platform, Steam, over the months from the years July 2012- Febuary 2021. The data set has records of 1258 games (also includes other miscellaneous pieces of software), and includes their titles, monthly player peaks, monthly average players at the same time, monthly gains/losses of players compared to the previous month, and the percentage of how closely the average players approach the peak.


>Running the data & cleaning up

```{r}
# Storing dataset in `games`
games <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-03-16/games.csv")

#cleaning it up

games <- games %>% 
  mutate( number_of_month = match(games[1:83631,3], month.name) ) %>% 
  select(gamename,year,number_of_month,everything()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(year), number_of_month)
  games
```
>How many games are in the data set

```{r}
# Finding the distinct number of `gamenames`
 dist_g <- games %>% 
  distinct(gamename)

dist_g
```

> 1. Do games lose popularity overtime? Does multiplayer/esports titles and single player games differ?

### Case 1

```{r}
g_payday <- games %>% 
  filter(gamename == "PAYDAY 2") %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2012:2021)) %>% 
  mutate(label = if_else(number_of_month == max(number_of_month), as.character(year), NA_character_))
g_payday

#makes the PAYDAY 2 dataframe 

Years_Payday2 <- as.factor(g_payday$year)
ggplot(g_payday,aes(x = number_of_month,y = avg, group = year, color = Years_Payday2)) +
geom_line(size = 1) +
geom_point()+ 
scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 12, by = 1),expand=c(0, 1))+ 
geom_dl(aes(label = year), method = list(dl.trans(x = x + 0.1), "last.points", cex = 1)) +
scale_colour_manual(values=c("#964B00","#f58231","#030000", "#00FBFE", "#3cb44b", "#FF0004", "#4363d8", "#911eb4", "#f032e6", "#a9a9a9" )) +
  xlab("Months")+
  ylab("Average Players")

#auto color pallet if + scale manual is removed
```

## Case 2: Player Unknown's Battlegrounds

```{r}
g_pubg <- games %>% 
  filter(gamename == "PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS") %>%

###As you can see when it comes to single player games dip after launch 



```{r}
g_fallout4 <- games %>% 
  filter(gamename == "Fallout 4") %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2012:2021)) %>% 
  mutate(label = if_else(number_of_month == max(number_of_month), as.character(year), NA_character_))
g_fallout4


Years_fallout4 <- as.factor(g_fallout4$year)
ggplot(g_fallout4,aes(x = number_of_month,y = avg, group = year, color = Years_fallout4)) +
geom_line(size = 1) +
geom_point()+ 
scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 12, by = 1),expand=c(0, 1))+ 
geom_dl(aes(label = year), method = list(dl.trans(x = x + 0.1), "last.points", cex = 1)) +
scale_colour_manual(values=c("#964B00","#f58231","#030000", "#00FBFE", "#3cb44b", "#FF0004", "#4363d8", "#911eb4", "#f032e6", "#a9a9a9" )) +
  xlab("Months")+
  ylab("Average Players")
```




```{r}
g_farcry5 <- games %>% 
  filter(gamename == "Far Cry 5") %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2012:2021)) %>% 
  mutate(label = if_else(number_of_month == max(number_of_month), as.character(year), NA_character_))
g_farcry5


Years_farcry5 <- as.factor(g_farcry5$year)
ggplot(g_farcry5,aes(x = number_of_month,y = avg, group = year, color = Years_farcry5)) +
geom_line(size = 1) +
geom_point()+ 
scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 12, by = 1),expand=c(0, 1))+ 
geom_dl(aes(label = year), method = list(dl.trans(x = x + 0.1), "last.points", cex = 1)) +
scale_colour_manual(values=c("#964B00","#f58231","#030000", "#00FBFE", "#3cb44b", "#FF0004", "#4363d8", "#911eb4", "#f032e6", "#a9a9a9" )) +
  xlab("Months")+
  ylab("Average Players")
```






### Case 3 as the seasons change avg playship goes up and down depending on holidays: note from randy on this: i checked it in excel this is accurate.

```{r}
games_growth <- games %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2012:2021)) %>% 
  group_by(number_of_month) %>% 
  summarise(avg_month_sum = sum(avg)) 
ggplot(data = games_growth) +
  geom_line(aes(x = number_of_month, y = avg_month_sum),color = "blue", size = 1) +
  geom_point(aes(x = number_of_month, y = avg_month_sum),color = "red", size = 3)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 12, by = 1),expand=c(0, 1))
games_growth
```

> This data suggests that there is a seasonality to Steam's player data. This shows that Steam has the most players around December, Janurary, and Feburary. We suspect that this occurs because of the Christmas season and people recieving money and games as gifts. We also see an increase in players during the summer months. We suspect that this occurs because individuals are out of school for their summer break, giving them more time to play video games on Steam.

> Question 2 growth of users overtime!

```{r}
games_user_growth <- games %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2012:2020)) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(avg_month_all_years = sum(avg))
ggplot(data = games_user_growth) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = avg_month_all_years),color = "blue", size = 1) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = avg_month_all_years),color = "red", size = 3) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2012, 2020, by = 1)) 
```
