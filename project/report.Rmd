# Final Report for Intro to Data Science: Steam Games

## Introduction

Steam is a popular, online video game distributor with many other complementing features. Steams hosts community discussion threads, access to download community-made modifications to games sold on the platform, social media-like user profiles and friends lists that displays the users overall or recent video game activity, and sales events which are based on holidays or unique themes.

We want to analyze a dataset regarding Steam games to dive deep into the behavior of gamers on the platform.


## Packages

Loading any needed packages.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(directlabels)
```

## The Dataset

The games.csv dataset has data collected for games on the popular game license selling platform, Steam, over the months from the years July 2012- Febuary 2021. The data set has records of 1258 games (also includes other miscellaneous pieces of software), and includes their titles, monthly player peaks, monthly average players at the same time, monthly gains/losses of players compared to the previous month, and the percentage of how closely the average players approach the peak.


>Running the data & cleaning up

```{r}
# Storing dataset in `games`
games <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-03-16/games.csv")

#cleaning it up

games <- games %>% 
  mutate( number_of_month = match(games[1:83631,3], month.name) ) %>% 
  select(gamename,year,number_of_month,everything()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(year), number_of_month)
  games
```
>How many games are in the data set

```{r}
# Finding the distinct number of `gamenames`
 dist_g <- games %>% 
  distinct(gamename)

dist_g
```

> 1. Can we prove that games generally follow seasonal changes?


```{r}
g_payday <- games %>% 
  filter(gamename == "PAYDAY 2") %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2012:2021)) %>% 
  mutate(label = if_else(number_of_month == max(number_of_month), as.character(year), NA_character_))
g_payday

#makes the PAYDAY 2 dataframe 

Years_Payday2 <- as.factor(g_payday$year)
ggplot(g_payday,aes(x = number_of_month,y = avg, group = year, color = Years_Payday2)) +
geom_line(size = 1) +
geom_point()+ 
scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 12, by = 1),expand=c(0, 1))+ 
geom_dl(aes(label = year), method = list(dl.trans(x = x + 0.1), "last.points", cex = 1)) +
scale_colour_manual(values=c("#964B00","#f58231","#030000", "#00FBFE", "#3cb44b", "#FF0004", "#4363d8", "#911eb4", "#f032e6", "#a9a9a9" )) +
  xlab("Months")+
  ylab("Average Players")

#auto color pallet if + scale manual is removed
```

> growth of users overtime

```{r}
games_2015 <- games %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2012:2020)) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(avg_month = sum(avg))
ggplot(data = games_2015) +
