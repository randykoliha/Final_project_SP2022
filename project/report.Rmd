# Final Report for Intro to Data Science: Steam Games

## Introduction

Steam is a popular, online video game distributor with many other complementing features. Steams hosts community discussion threads, access to download community-made modifications to games sold on the platform, social media-like user profiles and friends lists that displays the users overall or recent video game activity, and sales events which are based on holidays or unique themes.

We want to analyze a dataset regarding Steam games to dive deep into the behavior of gamers on the platform.


## Packages

Loading any needed packages.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(directlabels)
```

## The Dataset

The games.csv dataset has data collected for games on the popular game license selling platform, Steam, over the months from the years July 2012- Febuary 2021. The data set has records of 1258 games (also includes other miscellaneous pieces of software), and includes their titles, monthly player peaks, monthly average players at the same time, monthly gains/losses of players compared to the previous month, and the percentage of how closely the average players approach the peak.

>Running the data & cleaning up

```{r}
# Storing dataset in `games`
games <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-03-16/games.csv")

#cleaning it up

games <- games %>% 
  mutate( number_of_month = match(games[1:83631,3], month.name) ) %>% 
  select(gamename,year,number_of_month,everything()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(year), number_of_month)
  games
```
>How many games are in the data set

```{r}
# Finding the distinct number of `gamenames`
dist_g <- games %>% 
  distinct(gamename) 

dist_g

# in alpha order

 dist_g_alpha <- games %>% 
  distinct(gamename) %>% 
  arrange(gamename)

dist_g_alpha
```

# **Question 1: Do all games lose popularity overtime? How do multiplayer and single player titles differ?**

**Case 1**

```{r}
g_payday <- games %>% 
  filter(gamename == "PAYDAY 2") %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2012:2021)) %>% 
  mutate(label = if_else(number_of_month == max(number_of_month), as.character(year), NA_character_))
g_payday

#makes the PAYDAY 2 dataframe 

Years_Payday2 <- as.factor(g_payday$year)
ggplot(g_payday,aes(x = number_of_month,y = avg, group = year, color = Years_Payday2)) +
geom_line(size = 1) +
geom_point()+ 
scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 12, by = 1),expand=c(0, 1))+ 
geom_dl(aes(label = year), method = list(dl.trans(x = x + 0.1), "last.points", cex = 1)) +

> This data shows that singleplayer titles seem to have a drastic fall off in their player base following the launch of the game. This most likely occurs because once someone beats a single player game they are less likely to return to it. This can also be attributed to the fact that multiplayer/esports games are usally continually updated with new content single player game typically are less likely to receive these updates consistently.

# **Question 2: Is the Steam platform effected by seasonality?**

```{r}

games_seasons




games_seasons_pk <- games %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2012:2021)) %>% 
  group_by(number_of_month) %>% 
  summarise(peak_month_sum = sum(peak))

  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  xlab("Months")+
  ylab("Peak Number of Players") +
  labs(title = "Steam Seasonality using Peak Players")
games_seasons_pk


```

> This data suggests that there is a seasonality to Steam's player data. This shows that Steam has the most players around December, Janurary, and Feburary. We suspect that this occurs because of the Christmas season and people recieving money and games as gifts. The steep fall off we see in Feburary we suspect occurs because individuals have completed the games they recieved during the holiday season. We also see an increase in players during the summer months. We suspect that this occurs because individuals are out of school for their summer break, giving them more time to play video games on Steam.

# **Question 3: What does the growth of Steam platform look like from 2012 - 2021?**

```{r}
games_user_growth <- games %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2012:2020)) %>%

  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  xlab("Years")+
  ylab("Peak Number of Players") +
  labs(title = "Steam Platform Growth using Peak Players")
games_user_growth_pk


```

> Looking at the data we can see that the Steam platform has had relatively consistent growth from 2012 to 2020. However can see the only time Steam has a drop in users was from 2018 to 2019. We suspect this to be related to the rise of other online games market places such as the EPIC Games store and the popularity of Fortnite at the time. In November of 2018 Fortnite hit a  with 8.3 million concurrent players. We suspect that the popuarity of Fortnite combined with the fact that it was not on Steam is ultimately what caused the dip in players from 2018-2019.
